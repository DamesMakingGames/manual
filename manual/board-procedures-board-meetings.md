Board meetings will be held on the last Saturday of every month (or more or less frequently, or at a different time as determined by the Directors, but at any rate on a regular and scheduled basis) and conducted to carry out the business of the Board. The purpose of the meeting shall be expressed in its agenda.

See Section 26-28 of the DMG Bylaws for more details about how and by whom board meetings may be called.

A meeting agenda, prepared by the Chair of the Board or Secretary and circulated prior to the start of the meeting, will establish issues to be addressed.

### Voting

A majority of the votes cast by the Directors shall determine the motions in meeting. If there is a tie, then the majority requirement is not met and the vote cannot pass.

### Minutes

Minutes recorded at the Board meeting, and subsequently approved as written by the Board at the next meeting, will be the official record of the Board’s transactions and plans.

## Annual Planning Session

The Board will also hold an annual planning meeting, at which the Board will review and establish an updated three-year plan and an annual business plan. The plans will:

- Determine what the Board intends to accomplish for the coming year
- Articulate the Board’s planning accomplishments as realistic, concrete, and meaningful outcomes
- Adopt or update an appropriate strategic plan for achieving the outcomes
- Identify appropriate timelines for the accomplishments of the plan
- Establish a schedule for, and the means of, evaluating the performance of the Board

_All_ of our policies have anti-oppression implications and considerations built into them. We see anti-oppression as an approach to analyzing our organizational structure, our interpersonal relationships and our cultural context. To create real change, we commit to listening and working towards a collective understanding of anti-oppression within DMG.

We take time to analyze our cultural structures, identify things that need to change, and take action. We explicitly examine power relationships and hierarchies, with an emphasis on identifying intersections and distinctions between forms of oppression.

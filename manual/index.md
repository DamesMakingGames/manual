## So, why are you here?

People join DMG for lots of different reasons. Here are a few of the kinds of people who are part of this organization:

- Anyone interested in exploring ways to express themselves creatively through games, computer programming and interactive digital experiences
- Students who need additional support and opportunities for learning outside the classroom
- Artists who enjoy the supportive, welcoming and stimulating environment DMG provides, even if they’re not creating games \(yet!\)
- Experienced game designers who want to contribute to the community
- People interested in developing technical and artistic skills, who want to hone their craft in an informal environment

One of our goals is to remove obstacles to our members’ self-defined success, and the best way you can help us do that is to think about what you hope to get out of DMG and contribute as a member. We ask these questions in your membership application, and look forward to talking to you about your aspirations at an event.

> ‚ÄúBut we are a play community, and playing the way we do, for fun, for everyone‚Äôs fun, in public ‚Äì our fun little community becomes something else. To those who want to be seen as people who embrace life, embrace each other, embrace spontaneity, freedom, laughter; we are an alternative. An invitation. We play as if the game isn‚Äôt important. The rules aren‚Äôt important. As if _the only really important thing is each other_.‚Äù ‚Äì Bernie DeKoven

## So, why are you here?

People join DMG for lots of different reasons. Here are a few of the kinds of people who are part of this organization:

- Anyone interested in exploring ways to express themselves creatively through games, computer programming and interactive digital experiences
- Students who need additional support and opportunities for learning outside the classroom
- Artists who enjoy the supportive, welcoming and stimulating environment DMG provides, even if they‚Äôre not creating games \(yet!\)
- Experienced game designers who want to contribute to the community
- People interested in developing technical and artistic skills, who want to hone their craft in an informal environment

One of our goals is to remove obstacles to our members‚Äô self-defined success, and the best way you can help us do that is to think about what you hope to get out of DMG and contribute as a member. We ask these questions in your membership application, and look forward to talking to you about your aspirations at an event.

We encourage DMG event organizers to acknowledge the people whose stolen territory settlers are situated on. Our board and community leadership commits to deepening our engagement with the decolonial project, humbly seeking conversations with Indigenous communities, engaging with it individually and continually considering the purpose of and working to improve verbal acknowledgments.

This acknowledgment is meant to:

1. Connect settlers with the diverse Indigenous history of Toronto
2. Remind our community of the persistence and violence of settler colonialism
3. Spur each of us to work individually and collectively toward the reclamation of Indigenous sovereignty, self-determination and jurisdiction. [#LandBack](https://redpaper.yellowheadinstitute.org/)

DMG is situated on land that is the territory of the [Huron-Wendat](https://wendake.ca/) and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the [Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation](http://mncfn.ca/). We honor the sovereignty of the Indigenous people and nations whose land we live, work and play on. The territory was the subject of the Dish With One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee people and allied nations to collectively share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.

We are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.

## Prep

A few days before an event, the assigned captain should:

- Review any event logistics/tech notes in Airtable to ensure you understand what prep is required
- Contact all registered volunteers to inform them of their duties/expectations for the event and confirm arrival and departure times
- Print registration list \(admin only\)
  - On the admin site event page, navigate to "Attendees" and click the "Print" button.

### Volunteer Tasks

Most regular events need **at least** 2 DMG people – a captain and a volunteer.

1. A **captain** \(typically a programming committee member or organizer\) who will do prep, setup, and technical support and stay for cleanup and lockup.
2. A **second** who will manage the front door and attendees, and assist with cleanup.

#### **Tech**

_For socials and workshops, this is likely the captain_

- Help presenter test laptop connection with HDMI cable or Chromecast 15 minutes before start time, in case you need to hunt down a dongle or troubleshoot the projector.
- Prep computers that will be loaned out with any required software/updates at least 1-2 hours prior to event, or in the days before.
- Technical assistance with material/support instructor
- Ensure participants are in the dedicated Slack channel for the event, if there is one, and that they have downloaded and installed any prerequisite software.

#### **Door/registration**

- A volunteer to open the front door of the facility and give attendees directions to DMG. **Always** required for events happening only in the DMG workshop space after 6 p.m. or on the weekend as the front door will normally be locked at this time.
- This volunteer should have the registration list, and be informed ahead of time if non-registrants will be allowed in.
- 20 minutes after the start of the event, the door volunteer can come up to the workshop space. Late arrivals may Slack the organizer to be let in \(in certain cases\) as the door will be locked.
- Should not be the tech support person.

#### **Setup**

_For socials and regular workshops, this is likely the captain_

- **Workshops/classes**
  - Standard workshop room setup. Chairs facing front of room only.
- **Lectures/presentations**
  - Move tables, remove power cables, and set up 30 folding chairs 20-30 minutes prior to start time.
- Get snacks and set up food table.
- Put sandwich board sign out in front of building and prop workshop door with wedge.
- Print and/or post wayfinding signage.

## Clean up

- Fold and put away chairs and tables – the room should always be reset to workshop formation: Four rows of two tables, with four chairs in each row facing the front of the room.
- Put away laptops, power cables, mice, etc. in their marked bins and drawers.
- Sweep and wipe up any spills.
- Close all windows and turn off the lights.
- Make sure everyone is out of the space. **Captain is the last one out.**
- Ensure stanchions are set up properly, and TMAC front door is locked and pulled closed tight.

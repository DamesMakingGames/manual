If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation in any DMG event, please talk to any of the following people:

- The host of the event you are attending \(listed on the event page\)
- Any DMG volunteer, staff person, or director
- Any member of the conflict resolution committee:
  - Santo Aveiro-Ojeda \(co-chair\)
  - Izzie Colpitts-Campbell \(co-chair\)
  - Jennie Robinson Faber \(ex-officio\)
  - Kaitlin Tremblay
  - Jen Costa

Email [hr@dmg.to](mailto:hr@dmg.to) to reach the current chair \(or co-chairs\) of the conflict resolution committee.

To make an anonymous report, please use [this form](/report).

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

## Response Process

1. When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible.
2. Next, if you agree, members of the CR team will meet to decide what our response will be.
3. Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account.
4. If the problem is not harassing, and does not impact your human rights or safety, we may ask all involved parties to schedule a time to engage in a conflict resolution process at a later date.

## Confidentiality

We keep incident reports confidential in order to protect victims of abuse. DMG may privately warn third parties about a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of DMG members or the general public. We will never name harassment victims without their consent.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement \(solely at your request, unless the physical safety of someone else is threatened\).

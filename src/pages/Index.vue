          We strive to prioritize the experiences of Black, Indigenous,
          racialized and people of color, and give up space as part of our work
          towards redressing dispossession, oppression, settler colonialism and
          the living legacy of racism. We expect all of our members to do the
          same.

          If these identities do not describe you, that doesn't mean you aren't
          welcome here! It just means that our time, effort, attention, and
          programming revolves around needs and interests that might not match
          your own. We hope you'll join as a friend, and look for ways your
          skills and experience can support our mission and our membership.
        </p>

        <p>
          We acknowledge the work of creating a safer, more equitable space is
          work that will never be complete, and that we're not perfect. The
          terms we use to describe our experience are always changing, and we
          are always listening and learning. We are eager to maintain and defend
          the inclusivity of this community.

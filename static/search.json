We were incorporated as a not-for-profit by the founding board of directors \\(Jennie Faber, Cecily Carver, and Alex Leitch\\) in 2012. Today, DMG has grown into an active organization with seasonal programming and exhibitions, supporting its 550+ Toronto members and the broader game arts and culture community.\n\nDMG has presented over 250 artist talks, hosted 4 residency programs, presented over 500 professional and artistic development workshops, participated in scholarly collaborations \\(OCAD, York University\\), exhibited member work locally and internationally \\(Different Games, Indiecade at the Museum of the Moving Image NYC\\), curated local \\(AGO First Thursdays, Long Winter\\) and international \\(Brandeis University, Boston Festival of Independent Games\\) shows, developed open-source technical tools and platforms \\(iV Engine, Soba, CODEX, Community Development Toolkit\\), and coordinated youth arts mentorship programs \\(the TAC and Canada Council-funded Indigicade in collaboration with Indigenous Routes\\).\n\n### Mission\n\n**DMG is a not-for-profit video game arts organization that supports people historically excluded from or pushed out of tech and game spaces – especially gender-marginalized and racialized people – to make, play and critique video games within a cultural context.**\n\nWe teach computing skills for artistic expression, offer production and exhibition facilities, and provide community support for the creation of new artworks.\n\nOur space and community is a platform and playground for artists working in games, engaging the public with the expressive potential of this medium.\n\n### Vision\n\n**DMG is building a future where everyone can express themselves freely through games, where play contributes to a more just and equitable world.**\n\nGrounded in the heart of Toronto’s West Queen West neighbourhood, DMG is creating an accessible, diverse and collaborative space where anyone can engage meaningfully with computer games, digital art and immersive media art. DMG integrates creation, production, presentation, education and critical practices with a focus on community building and inclusivity.\n\nWith year-round arts and cultural programming, an equipment library, dedicated public gallery, coworking and social areas, we provide our members and the broader game arts community the tools, space and freedom to play.\n\nOur vision and programming is open and adaptive, responding to the needs and wants of our membership.\n\n### Milieu\n\nDMG addresses all three streams of media art practice: Production, exhibition and distribution. Our members create and display their artworks using time-based technologies including computer and analog games, sound/audio, video, robotics and electronics, immersive and interactive, Web-based, electronics, radio and sound.  \nOur sector is extremely well developed in Toronto, with over 40 organizations serving and supporting a broad community of media art makers.\n\n### Values\n\n- We value diversity and strive to a deep understanding of barriers to inclusion\n- We recognize and honour our visible and invisible differences\n- We value the labor that goes into defending and building equitable experiences\n- We value healing and restoration\n- We value friendship and trusting relationships\n- We value humility, openness and generosity\n\n### Beliefs & Commitments\n\n- We are committed to the ongoing work of anti-oppression and anti-racism.\n- We believe game-making can be an act of resistance, giving creators ultimate agency in the expression of their identities, politics, selves, genders and sexualities. Our work has the power to transform our communities, and positively impact policies and practice.\n- We believe that creating space and time to make and talk about games in an explicitly feminist context elevates the craft, amplifies alternative and diverse narratives, and supports the socio-cultural changes that are necessary to make game design accessible to all.\n- We are interested in creating alternative forms of economic power grounded in solidarity, openness and collective values.\n- We are committed to developing, contributing to, experimenting with, promoting and sharing knowledge about free and open source tools and platforms.\n- We recognize this is ongoing work, that we make mistakes, and we must always push forward\n- We make, play and talk about games because they give us more power to shape the future.\n"},{"title":"Director Register","path":"/manual/board-register/","summary":"Current and past directors of the board.","content":"\n### Current Directors\n\n| Name                    | Office                     | Election     | Term End      |\n| :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------- | :------------ |\n| Izzie Colpitts-Campbell | Chair, president           | Nov 27, 2014 | Nov 27, 2020  |\n| Santo Aveiro-Ojeda      | Vice chair, vice president | Feb 28, 2016 | Feb 28, 2020  |\n| Natalie Zina Walschots  | Treasurer                  | Jan 12, 2019 | Jan 25, 2021  |\n| Kaitlin Tremblay        | Secretary                  | Jan 12, 2019 | Jan 25, 2021  |\n| Shel Kahn               |                            | Jan 25, 2020 | Jan 25, 2021  |\n| Jayd Matyas             |                            | Dec 12, 2018 | Jan 25, 2021  |\n| Soha El-Sabaawi         |                            | Nov 27, 2014 | Nov 27, 2020  |\n| Meagan Byrne            |                            | Jan 14, 2017 | April 1, 2020 |\n\n### Past Directors\n\n| Name                  | Office    | Election     | Term Ended    |\n| :-------------------- | :-------- | :----------- | :------------ |\n| Alex Leitch           | Treasurer | Aug 30, 2012 | Dec 18, 2014  |\n| Stephanie Fisher      |           | Nov 27, 2014 | April 7, 2015 |\n| Cecily Carver         |           | Aug 30, 2012 | Jan 12, 2019  |\n| Jennie Robinson Faber |           | Aug 30, 2012 | Jan 12, 2019  |\n| Yifat Shaik           |           | Jan 19, 2017 | Jan 19, 2020  |\n| Rose Goodwin          |           | Jan 12, 2019 | Jan 12, 2020  |\n"},{"title":"Officers' Roles","path":"/manual/officers-roles/","summary":"Information about the responsibilities and roles of directors.","content":"\n# Officers of the Corporation\n\n## Role of the President\n\nAccording to Section 31 in DMG’s Bylaws:\n\n> If appointed, the president shall be the chief executive officer of the Corporation and shall be responsible for implementing the strategic plans and policies of the Corporation.

Convey the consequences without discussing details or rationale, and say: \"If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact \\[x\\], but in the meantime, you must \\[x\\].\"\n\n**DO NOT** ask the victim for advice on how to deal with the complaint. **DO NOT** offer the victim input into penalties.\n\nOnce action has been taken, follow up with the victim and let them know what has been done, and that you are here to support them.\n\n### Incident log\n\nWhen an issue is reported, whether it is referred to the conflict resolution policy or considered a Code of Conduct violation, the CR committee should keep the original incident report up to date, covering:\n\n- If the offender has been warned, how did they respond? Were they contrite? Did they immediately stop the behavior?\n- Document every communication from staff or committee members related to the incident, especially to third parties.\n- Document the date of the CR committee meeting\\(s\\) and any decisions and follow-up communications related to the incident.\n- Refer to the CR committee terms of reference for more information on proper channels of communication and logging.\n\nThe CR committee should follow up with the complainant, record the full details of how the incident was resolved, and prepare a report for the board.\n\n### Sanctions\n\n#### About Apologies\n\nDo not ask the offender to apologize to the victim. DMG has no responsibility to enforce friendship, reconciliation, or anything beyond stopping harassment between members or event attendees.\n\nForcing a victim of harassment to acknowledge an apology from their harasser forces further contact with their harasser. It also creates a social expectation that they will accept the apology, forgive their harasser, and return their social connection to its previous status.\n\nIf the harasser offers to apologize to the victim, strongly discourage it. If a staff member relays an apology to the victim, it should be brief and not require a response.\n\nIf the harasser attempts to press an apology on someone who would clearly prefer to avoid them, or attempts to recruit others to relay messages on their behalf, this constitutes continued harassment and is grounds for permanent expulsion.\n\n### Data Retention\n\nAll initial incident reports and incident logs should be retained permanently, regardless of action taken against the harasser.\n\nReports should be stored in a Google Drive document, and access shared only with current CR committee members, staff and members of the board of directors. The chair of the CR committee should control access, removing and adding privileges as staff and members turn over.\n\nProviding access and information about the records should be part of the board member, staff, and committee onboarding process.\n"},{"title":"Running or Volunteering at an Event","path":"/manual/running-an-event/","summary":"Guidelines for helping out at or running a DMG event.","content":"\n## Prep\n\nA few days before an event, the assigned captain should:\n\n- Review any event logistics/tech notes in Airtable to ensure you understand what prep is required\n- Contact all registered volunteers to inform them of their duties/expectations for the event and confirm arrival and departure times\n- Print registration list \\(admin only\\)\n  - On the admin site event page, navigate to \"Attendees\" and click the \"Print\" button.\n\n### Volunteer Tasks\n\nMost regular events need **at least** 2 DMG people – a captain and a volunteer.\n\n1.

Everything we know about being a good mentor we've learned from mentors and facilitators at our programs, and owe a huge debt of gratitude to everyone who has helped set the tone for a truly supportive and collaborative community.\n\n## What is a DMG intensive?\n\nIt’s _not_ a \"learn to program\" course. We _don’t_ just teach a specific development environment or language, or how to make a certain type of game or interactive experience. We _do_ provide:\n\n- A crash course in/survey of a wide range of technical and creative aspects of game development \\(design principles, composing, visual art, project management, and more\\)\n- A game design vocabulary and opportunities to develop literacy around play\n- A safe and open place to talk about what games mean to us\n- A structured environment for individuals to find and express their creative voice and discover what interests them most about making games\n- A time and place for participants to learn from and support one another\n\n## Understanding DMG's goals and values\n\nDMG is a member organization that **values** collaborative learning, free self-expression, affirmation and creation. Learn more about us here:\n\n- [Member introduction](../)\n- [About DMG](https://dmg.to/about)\n\nPlease read and affirm our [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/), and talk to an organizer if you are confused about anything.\n\n## Understanding the goals of an intensive\n\nOur intensive programs \\(Damage Camps\\) are workshops that last four to six weeks with a set cohort of participants selected through an application process. The group meets two to three times per week, and receives one-on-one mentorship for the duration of the program. The purpose of our long programs is to:\n\n- Create a friendly, open, collaborative experience for participants\n- Provide a safe and playful space for exploring creative ideas, as well as learning problem-solving and technical skills\n- Facilitate meaningful connections between participants and more experienced members of the DMG and Toronto game communities\n- Expose established members of the community to valuable new perspectives\n- Help create makers, mentors, collaborators, and friends out of everyone involved\n\n## Who are you mentoring?\n\nIntensive participants come from a **wide variety of backgrounds** and have a range of skills, interests and knowledge. Get to know them!\n\n## Inclusive Language and Behavior\n\nIt is critical that a safe, stress-free and inclusive environment is maintained at all times. Here’s how you can do your part:\n\n### Respect Diverse Identities\n\n- Do not make assumptions about identity, experiences, or pronouns and always use a person's pronouns if they've been communicated \\(default to \"they\" if not\\)\n- Allow participants space and time to disclose as much or as little information about their identity and background as they wish\n- Treat all participants with respect and assume they know more about what they are trying to create than you do\n\n### Respect Space and Agency\n\n#### Do not touch or take the keyboard away. The keyboard is _lava!_\n\n- Grabbing someone's keyboard can be off-putting, scary, and demoralizing\n- Give clear directions and let participants do their own work – **if you're frustrated by the speed a participant is learning, you're in the wrong place**\n- If you absolutely must type something **\\(chances are you don't\\)**, ask \"May I?”, go slow and explain what you are doing\n\n#### Sexual jokes, remarks, and advances are never funny or appropriate\n\n#### Focus on the participants\n\n- Be available and attentive to participants throughout the work session.\n- Stay on the sidelines, but \"read the room\" by monitoring facial expressions visual cues that signal frustration. Ask, \"What are you struggling with? Can I help?\"\n- Avoid in-jokes and lengthy private conversations with other mentors - this can be alienating. Include participants in casual conversations.\n- Try to find and respect the core idea of the game and understand its style, even if it's something that doesn't appeal to you personally\n- Don't suggest that participants drastically alter their mechanics; help them improve on the game they've chosen to make.\n\n### \"Do\"s and \"Don't\"s for Respectful Critique and Discussion\n\n| Instead of…                     | Try…                                                                                                                                             |\n| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| \"This doesn't make sense.\"      | **Help articulate problems** \"Can you explain your thought process?\"                                                                             |\n| \"No.\"                           | \"You're heading in the right direction\" \"Yes, and…\"                                                                                              |\n| \"It doesn't work\" \"It's broken\" | \"Let's try to improve this part.\"                                                                                                                |\n| \"This is just like \\[Game X\\].\" | \"Check out these games – they're doing something similar.

This includes:\n\n- **Prioritizing** the expression of people who are systemically marginalized in tech and game spaces, especially those who are gender-marginalized and/or racialized and upholding a safe, judgment-free, confidential space for that expression.\n- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions.\n- Respecting physical and emotional boundaries.

While we welcome and include cis men in our space, we serve, prioritize and centre the gender marginalized, and invite those whose identities fall within that spectrum to speak at our socials.\n\nYou don't have to have created a polished, released game - even a sketch of an idea is interesting and we'd love to hear about it. We are interested all kinds of media artworks, computer and digital games – whether you're in a technical or non-technical role, a producer or support person, focused on music or art or narrative. Maybe you're not working on a game at all, but a writer, artist, musician producing work that game makers would be interested in or inspired by. We want you!\n\n### What's it like to give a presentation at a DMG event?\n\nAll **Speaker Socials** happen at our headquarters located at 32 Lisgar Street \\(in the new Toronto Media Arts Centre\\) in Toronto. We have a workshop that seats up to 24, and a studio space for our members to work and hang out.\n\nArrive at least 15 minutes before the start of the social, and we'll get you all set up. _If you need other specialized equipment, please let us know at least a day ahead of time._\n\nThe crowd is usually about 15-30 strong and a mix of independent game developers, designers, film and video artists, animators, people who work at small studios, freelancers, enthusiasts and more. A large proportion of the crowd comes from a non-technical background. The mood is casual, supportive, sociable and friendly.\n\nPresentations should be roughly 20 minutes long \\(shorter if more than three people are presenting, longer if you need more time and we've made special arrangements\\). Having some kind of visual component - slides or a demo of your game - is ideal.\n\n## Tech\n\nOur workshop is equipped with high-speed wi-fi and a projector with HDMI and Chromecast input. Check with the organizer ahead of time to make sure we have the dongle you need.\n\n### What should I talk about?\n\nThe following works pretty well as a format, but we invite you to break the \"rules\" and do what you like!\n\n#### 1. Intro\n\n_You, your background, and how you're involved with DMG if applicable_\n\nPeople want to know about you! What interests, skills, hobbies, and communities influence your work; why you're interested in games; what brought you to DMG \\(if you're a participant in a DMG program or new to the community\\). If your career path or area of study is related to games or influenced your project, say a few words about how you wound up there.\n\n#### 2. Project Background\n\n_Tell the story of your project and how it came to be._\n\n- Where did the idea come from?\n- Were you influenced by other related games or projects?\n- What challenges did you meet along the way? Did the project change as it progressed?\n- If you have any interesting anecdotes about the process, tell them!\n\n#### 3. Demo/Presentation\n\n_Show us what you've got!_\n\nIf your project is a game, play through a small part of it on screen, or throw up some screenshots, sketches or narrative maps. Point out the parts you're most proud of or interested in.\n\nIf you're presenting on a topic, take us through some visuals. Slides with minimal text and graphics/photos work best!\n\n#### 4. Ask-the-audience\n\n_Ask the audience a question and get feedback on a problem you're struggling with_\n\nIf you have future plans for growing or changing the project, talk about what they are. Looking for help or collaborators? Let people know.\n\nWe don't normally do a Q&A at the end of talks, but you're welcome to invite questions and discussion if you like.\n\nYou could ask for feedback about a specific aspect of your project. This could be about game design \\(\"What isn't working about this?\"\\), the interface \\(\"How do I make the actions available to the player more clear?\"\\), research \\(\"Who's doing interesting work that I should check out?\"\\), collaboration \\(\"I'm looking for a sound designer…\"\\).\n\n### Remember!\n\n- **Wherever you're at, it's good enough!** Try to avoid self-deprecating phrases or apologizing for the state of your project (we know, it can be hard!). Assume that the audience is excited to hear what you have to say - they are. This sets a open and encouraging tone for everyone in the room who is working on a progress they might be shy about sharing.\n- **Your perspective is unique:** Remember that there will be people in the audience who are less experienced than you — your work may be the motivation they need to make their first game or get involved with the community. You have skills and experience and interesting ideas - you never know who or what you might inspire.\n- **Allow the community to participate:** Sharing the difficult parts of your process, the setbacks and failures, make your work relatable. And asking for feedback or help on a specific component lets the audience contribute and get involved in your project in small way that just might lead to a breakthrough. Be open to new ideas – it's a chance to build relationships and deepen your work.\n- **Use inclusive language:** DMG strives to provide a space as free as possible from linguistic and physical/environmental barriers and aggressions. We ask that everyone part of this community, but especially workshop leaders and speakers at our events, be **very intentional in their speech**, aware of the words they use and the effect they may have on attendees, and humble when corrected or questioned. Read [Avoiding Ableist Language](/manual/avoiding-ableist-language/).\n\nIf you would like to practice ahead of time or rehearse your talk, we would be happy to arrange for you to do so ahead of time.\n\n### A note about recording\n\nWe sometimes video and audio record speakers at our socials, with permission, and create edited videos and text transcripts of the presentations. We post these videos and articles on our members-only site. Please let us know if you would prefer we did not record your presentation, or if you would like to see it before it is made public.\n\nWe can provide you with the source for the video, and you are free to post and share it however you like.\n\n[**Submit your proposal!**](https://dmg.to/applications/speaker-social)\n"},{"title":"How to Run a Game Jam","path":"/manual/how-to-run-a-game-jam/","summary":"Guidelines for planning and running a game jam.","content":"\nDepending on the nature of the jam and experience level of the participants, more or less structure than outlined here may be appropriate.

These individuals should wear name badges and also state their pronouns.\n* Set expectations by presenting the schedule, including any lunch/dinner times, workshops, presentations or check-ins.\n* Post the code of conduct on a wall or in your group chat. Review the procedure for reporting any issues or violations in confidence.\n* Let jammers know they can work solo or in groups, and encourage them to chat with fellow participants about their skills, abilities and goals for the jam to find a good fit. Encourage jammers to talk to volunteers/coordinator if they’re feeling frustrated, stuck or confused as they’re all there solely to help.\n\n### Talk\\(s\\)\n\n_1 hour, e.g. 10 a.m.-11 a.m._\n\nIf running a tutorial or workshop during the jam \\(great for first-timers\\), do it at the beginning of the jam and keep it brief and tailored to the participants. Suggested topics for jams geared toward first-timers:\n\n- \"How to Jam\":https://dmg.to/blog/34 \\(include tips, survey of jam games for context and inspiration\\)\n- Software tutorial \\(walk through modifying an existing game - good if everyone’s using the same tool, such as Playmaker or Twine\\)\n- Game design concepts \\(higher level, good if participants are focusing on a theme rather than tool or format, or largely from another artistic discipline\\)\n\n### Morning Work Time\n\n1 hour, e.g. 11 a.m.-12 p.m.\n\nThis will be a quiet time as everyone settles into their workflow and refines their idea. Some people will probably be sketching ideas on paper or a whiteboard, making notes or an outline. No one’s running into any technical issues at this point.\n\n### Lunch\n\n1 hour, e.g. 12 p.m.-1 p.m.\n\nIf catering is being provided and space allows, set up in a space away from where jammers are working and encourage people to take a break and chat with each other about what they’re working on. You’ll need volunteers to help out with setting up and cleaning up food. Be sure that any food ordered to accommodate specific dietary requirements is clearly labeled, and that the  participants know that it is available for them.\n\n### Afternoon\n\n_5 hours, e.g. 1 p.m.-6 p.m._\n\nBy now, many participants will be getting into the deep end. Some people may be floundering a bit about what to do next, others will have specific technical questions. Now’s a good time to:\n\n- Remind people to work in a spiral - start by building something small but complete, build iteratively, and articulate each step in their design.\n- Have brief one-on-one conversations about goals for the end of the day and end of the jam to keep everyone’s expectations reasonable, and to ensure no one feels lost or left behind.\n- Tip: If someone’s feel stuck or not sure what to work on next, ask them what they’re dreading doing tomorrow/least excited about and have them work on that, and talk through it with a mentor. This is prime energy and excitement time, exploit it!\n- Be an example - get up for breaks, drink water and stretch!\n\nIf the jam starts later in the day, you'll have time for a dinner break and an evening check in. Shift everything up if you're running shorter/earlier.\n\n### Dinner\n\n_1 hour, e.g. 6-7 p.m._\n\n### Evening\n\n_2 hours, e.g 7-9 p.m._\n\nAbout 30 minutes before the end of the day, check in with where everyone’s at and ask if they’d like to show their progress to the group. Have jammers gather around each participant’s computer to see what they’re working on. Don’t pressure anyone to demo - keep it light, informal and encouraging. You might want to avoid a dramatic countdown to end time as that can be stressful and put people off sharing.\n\nRemind everyone to back up their games. We usually pass around a USB stick so we know everyone’s done it, for redundancy and archival purposes!\n\nEnergy may be flagging and some people will want to pack up and head home before the day is wrapped. That’s okay! Tell them you’re excited to see where they’re at tomorrow.\n\n## Jam Day 2\n\n### Morning\n\n_3 hours, e.g. 9 a.m.-12 p.m._\n\nEnergy will vary wildly at the beginning of the day. Some people will be excited about the final jam day and eager to get cracking. You don’t have to worry about them too much.\n\n🚨 Others will be considering switching tools, scrapping their idea, or significantly modifying it. What you advise them to do will depend on their personal goals, the state of the work they did on day 1 and the context of the jam.\n\nSome tips:\n\n- *Switching tools very rarely solves a game design problem.* It’s tempting to do if you’re having trouble getting your game to do something that seems simple, but comes with its own set of unknowns and issues. Strongly advise against this. Instead, think about the problem from a play/design point of view and ask for input from mentors and other jammers if they're available. Describe the design problem, rather than the technical issue.\n- *Scrapping an idea and starting from scratch doesn’t accomplish much.* Remember, the jam is about the process, so any idea will do. If you don’t like your idea anymore, that’s ok! After today you can abandon it. Instead, try swapping out one element, such as your art or writing, for something completely different. In other projects, abandoning an idea is often good advice, but in a jam, capitalizing on momentum and the work you've already done to complete something small will yield great rewards.\n- Overwhelmed by the work you have left to do? Cutting features, editing and paring down is a great idea! In fact, remove as much as you can - the simpler your goals, the more likely you’ll end up with something small that you’re proud of. This is something amateur and professional game developers do all the time and it’s a valuable design skill.\n\n### Lunch\n\n_1 hour, e.g. 12-1 p.m._\n\nUse lunchtime for brief demo/group check-ins for anyone who missed last night’s end-of-day presentations.\n\n### Afternoon\n\n_5 hours, e.g. 1-6 p.m._\n\n- Everyone should be feeling good about their progress. Walk the room every hour or so and check in with anyone looking lost or frustrated.\n- Remind mentors now is an important time to make themselves available to jammers. Stay present and aware.\n- Offer to playtest and provide feedback to anyone who’s close to being finished, and remind the go-getters they can revisit anything they cut out earlier now, as they have a few hours til the end of the jam.\n\nBack up your games! This is prime data-corruption time, so pass around the USB stick.\n\n### Dinner\n\n_1 hour, e.g. 6-7 p.m._\n\n### Final Check-In\n\n_7:15 p.m._\n\nCalmly let everyone know how much time they have and give out pep talks as required. There will be some buzz and excitement, but make sure no one’s feeling too anxious. “Wherever you’re at at the end is great and everyone’s excited to see what you’ve been working on!” Skip the dramatic countdown.\n\nGet one-on-one confirmation from each jammer that they’re up for presenting, so no one feels put on the spot or obligated to speak in front of the group at presentation time. Make a list of who’s in.\n\n### Presentations\n\n_1 hour, e.g. 8-9 p.m._\n\nPencils down! Have the group gather around each jammer in turn. Some people may try to use this time to keep working on their own game, and should be encouraged respectfully to join the group and support their fellow jammers.\n\nEach jammer talks about their game and the work they did/issues they encountered/favorite parts for ~5 minutes, giving others the chance to play.\n\n### Closing Remarks\n\n_10 minutes_\n\nThank volunteers and staff, congratulate participants on their work. Let everyone know if there’s an additional public showcase date or other follow up post-jam.\n\nSend people home with a token if you can – we do jam t-shirts. A badge, pin or custom sticker pack would be cool!\n\n## General Tips\n\n### Setting realistic expectations\n\nOne of the biggest problems you’ll encounter is frustration arising from a participant realizing they can’t make the game they wanted to with the time, resources and skills they have available at the jam. Counter this by reminding them that this is NOT the time to try to make their magnum opus, their big grand idea. This is practice and it's really valuable. Their future magnum opus will benefit greatly from this experience. This jam is about the process of working within specific constraints and achieving a contained, precise goal.\n\n*Personal goals trump themes, experience trumps output, understanding is more important than productivity.*\n\n### Minimizing interruptions\n\n- Don’t shout announcements at the group or interrupt someone who looks focused. Respect the discipline it takes to concentrate on a new skill/project for a weekend and let people work and settle into their own routine/workflow.\n- Countdowns are stressful, avoid!\n- Initiate conversations with a statement rather than a question \\(“It looks like you’re having trouble with something.” “You look like you just solved a tricky bug!”\\) so that jammers can ask for the help if they need it or just nod if they don’t want to be interrupted. Look available \\(pace the room quietly, observe facial expressions and approach jammers who look distressed\\). [Here are some more tips for mentors!](https://manual.dmg.to/manual/mentorship-guidelines/)\n- Discourage volunteers and mentors from gathering and chatting near the jammers for extended periods of time as this can be distracting and alienating \\(it’s hard to ask for help from someone engaged in a personal conversation\\).\n\n### Latecomers\n\nMake sure latecomers don’t feel left out. Find them a seat and power, introduce them to nearby jammers, give them the rundown of where you’re at in the schedule and find out what they’re going to work on.\n\n### Volunteers\n\nKeep coffee flowing, help maintain a clean jam space, find dongles and power bars, pick up food from caterer or restaurant or greet and guide them in, and answer logistical questions.\n\n### Getting Jammers Unstuck: Working in a spiral\n\nStart with the simplest mechanic in your game, and work in small chunks. Get one feature working completely before adding complexity. Build on complete features to work them into your game system, testing as you go. Examples:\n\n- Twine: A very simplified version of your full game - 4 rooms instead of 40. Or, start with a simplified outline in a writing program.\n- Platformer: Get your character moving left and right on the screen before adding obstacles and jump mechanics.\n- Adventure game/visual novel: Get one dialog interaction working before doing all your art.\n"},{"title":"Livetweeting Guidelines","path":"/manual/how-to-tweet/","summary":"Guidelines for tweeting on behalf of DMG.","content":"\nThanks so much for volunteering your time and energy! This is a handy, at-a-glance guide to livetweeting a DMG event, including workshops, Speaker’s Socials, or showcases.\n\n## Accessing the Dames Making Games Twitter account:\n\nThe DMG official twitter account is [@DMGToronto](https://twitter.com/dmgtoronto). You can log in via Buffer from either a laptop or mobile device. The password will be provided to you by the [Community Promotion Committee](https://governance.dmg.to/committees/community-care.html) in advance of the event you are livetweeting.\n\nTo effectively livetweet for DMG, we ask you to be an active and attentive participant at the event you are attending. We know this requires focus and skill, and appreciate it a lot!\n\n## Before the event:\n\n- Ensure that you can log into the DMG Twitter account from the platform you are working from.\n- Make sure you have access to a device that they can effectively tweet from. If you don’t have one, we can lend you one.\n- Have a quick chat with any speakers or presenters to get their Twitter handle, the correct spelling of their name, and their preferred pronouns, so you can tag and speak about them accurately and respectfully.\n- Speak to whoever is introducing the event to ensure that they inform everyone that the livetweet is taking place, and to encourage everyone in the room to use the chosen hashtag for the event. \\(The presenter may have a hashtag chosen, so check in with them first, but if there is no preference then the responsibility for choosing a hashtag falls to DMG\\).\n- Make sure that everyone in attendance is aware that the livetweet is taking place, and ask anyone who wishes to not be tagged, photographed, quoted or otherwise discusses on social media to make sure they flag this preference to you.\n\n## During the event:\n\n- Tweet about exciting happenings; great quotes \\(or quote summaries\\); or questions; as well as especially salient points during the event you are attending.\n- You don’t have to tweet every cool thing you see or hear, but one tweet every 10-15 minutes would be great! You do not have to quote a participant directly, summarizing what they are saying is fine.\n- While it is not mandatory, snapping a photo or two of the action is always appreciated! Just make sure that everyone is comfortable being photographed before you post anything.\n  - Avoid photographing participants \\(for privacy reasons\\) and focus on the presenters whenever possible. You can also take screenshots of the workshop and post those.\n- Monitor the hashtag\\(s\\) chosen for the event, and retweet any content from other participants or attendees that you think is particularly funny, insightful, or otherwise deserves to be amplified.\n- Monitor the @DMGToronto notifications as well, and similarly retweet or respond to anything you think is relevant.\n- Have a great time! DMG events are rad.\n\n## Hashtags:\n\nEvery DMG event or type of event will have a hashtag associated with it that we will ask you to use for all of the content that you put out, and encourage everyone else attending the workshop to use.\n\nSome hashtags \\(such as \\#DMGwriting, \\#DMGVR, \\#DMGSpeakerSocial\\) are used for several different events, whereas others \\(\\#febfatale, \\#bitbazaar2017, \\#junicorn\\) are event-specific. You might find that there are some other hashtags that other folks are using that you might want to use as well, such as a conference hashtag or a discussion topic.\n\nSometimes, more than one hashtag is relevant \\(for example, you might be at a \\#bitbazaar2017 showcase and want to tag a \\#DMGVR game\\), so go ahead and use more than one, but just don’t let your tweets become too cluttered.\n\n## Voice and tone:\n\nWhile we are not overly concerned about a consistent brand voice or anything like that, since you will be taking over the official DMG account, please keep in mind that you are tweeting on our behalf and to do your best to respect the trust we place in all the livetweeters behind the helm.\n\nOur voice tends to be very positive and engaged, so bring your enthusiasm and attention to the role. Please be respectful and courteous to anyone you speak about or respond to.\n\n## A note about harassment:\n\nBecause of the world we live in, if you encounter any harassment, abuse or hate speech \\(or anything that makes you uncomfortable\\), please let the [Community Promotion Committee](https://governance.dmg.to/committees/community-care.html) know right away.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable about any responses that you get, Make us aware of them. If you need to stop tweeting or otherwise step back from social media mid livetweet because of something that you encounter or a response that you get, please let us know and do so. Protecting yourself is more important that capturing a funny quote.\n\n## Questions or concerns:\n\nIf you have a question to ask, feedback to give, a concern to raise or just need a pep talk before or a debrief after your livetweet, get in touch with us any time!\n"},{"title":"Territorial Acknowledgment","path":"/manual/territorial-acknowledgment/","summary":"Information about our territorial acknowledgment.","content":"\nWe encourage DMG event organizers to acknowledge the people whose stolen territory settlers are situated on.

All parties will be provided with updates during review processes.\n\n### Timeliness\n\nComplaints will be dealt with promptly and resolved as quickly as possible.\n\n### Fairness\n\nReview of complaints will be fair, impartial and respectful, allowing all parties to have their perspectives heard.\n\n### Thoroughness\n\nReview of complaints will be thorough and as detailed as possible, based upon the information provided by the parties.\n\n### Accessible and User-Friendly\n\nThe process will be easily accessible and communicated to members. It is designed to be clear and as simple to follow as possible.\n\n### Training and Professional Development\n\nThe organization will ensure conflict resolution is a central part of annual board governance training and staff professional development, and set aside time and resources to do so.\n\n## Responsibility for Implementation\n\nThis policy respects the governance structure of DMG which provides that Operational and Educational activities are the responsibility of the Executive Director, and matters relating to Board policy, activities, decisions and governance are the responsibility of the Board of Directors.\n"},{"title":"Conflict of Interest Policy","path":"/manual/conflict-of-interest-policy/","summary":"Information about DMG's conflict of interest policy.","content":"\nThe Board of Directors is responsible to the members of the Corporation and acts in their interests at all times.

Please see MANO's [Guides on HR, Governance, Equity and Conflict Resolution](https://mano-ramo.ca/guides-on-hr-governance-accessibility-equity-and-conflict-resolution/)_\n\n## Informal complaints & dispute resolution\n\n1. An informal conflict resolution effort happens when a person seeks information, expresses their concern\\(s\\), engages the other party to the dispute in dialogue, and is able to resolve a dispute without recourse to a formal complaint.\n2. When disagreements arise, it is expected that the parties involved will attempt to speak with each other about their concerns. In addition to the following considerations, both parties in this conversation will use the DMG Code of Conduct as their guide for how to conduct themselves in discussing the dispute.\n   - Choose a time and place to meet that is private and agreeable to both people\n   - Allow a reasonable amount of time.\n   - The meeting is not about one person “winning” and the other ”losing.” It is about coming to a mutual understanding. This takes patience and a willingness to listen to the other’s point of view and not to dismiss it as the “wrong” point of view.\n   - Speak directly from how you feel/think or felt/thought, and speak directly to the issue. By using “I” Statements and “Active Listening” techniques you can avoid belittling the other person, or dismissing their thoughts or feelings.\n   - Ideally you will be able to learn from the conversation how to avoid miscommunication and/or misunderstanding in future. Helpful questions to this end include, “If what I / you said or did came across like that, what should I / we do to guard against this happening again?”\n3. If step 2 does not work, the Complainant may ask for assistance, from the appropriate Responsible Contact Person \\(see below\\). This may be done orally or in writing.\n\n   When communicating in writing the complainant will note in their correspondence that they are making an informal complaint and are communicating in order to get help to resolve it.\n\n4. Responsible Contact People for Informal Complaint:\n   - **ED** as Complainant – contact the Chair. If the Respondent is the Chair, then contact the staff liaison on the Conflict Resolution Sub-committee. If the Respondents involve multiple directors, the ED will contact the Internal Advisor.\n   - **Director** as Complainant – contact the ED. If the respondent is the ED or Chair, then contact the Internal Advisor.\n   - **Member of the organization, or member of the public** as Complainant - contact designated staff. If the Respondent is the designated staff, contact the ED. If the Respondent is the ED, then contact the Internal Advisor.\n5. If approached with an informal complaint, the Responsible Contact Person will inquire about any initial resolution efforts \\(as per 1.03\\), and will consult as needed with the Internal Advisor.\n6. Efforts will be made by the Responsible Contact Person to resolve the matter informally within the first two \\(2\\) weeks after the complaint is made.\n   - The Responsible Contact Person will have a conversation with each party separately to: a\\) discuss their perspective on and interests engaged in the dispute, and; b\\) to review the internal informal dispute resolution methods available to them \\(as per 1.06.2\\).\n   - Both parties will be invited to participate in processes such as informal meetings, negotiations, facilitated meetings, or shuttle or in-person mediation. If there is more than one Complainant or Respondent this may involve multiple, separate meetings. If one party refuses participation in either facilitated discussions or a mediation process, see 2.01.\n   - Depending on their training and neutrality, either the Responsible Contact Person or the Internal Advisor will act as facilitator or mediator in the chosen process.\n   - If the chosen process yields an acceptable informal outcome to both parties, the matter will be considered to be resolved.\n\n## Formal complaints and resolution\n\n1. If informal resolution efforts do not achieve an acceptable outcome in a timely fashion, or to the satisfaction of the Complainant, the Complainant may submit a written formal complaint. A formal complaint requires written submission.\n2. A formal, written complaint will be submitted to one of the Responsible Contact People below. The written complaint must include:\n   - The Complainant’s name;\n   - Detailed information about what the issue is, the Respondent’s name, what has taken place, where, and when;\n   - Details of all prior efforts to achieve a resolution;\n   - The specific outcome\\(s\\) the Complainant is seeking.\n3. Responsible Contact People for Formal Complaints:\n   - **ED** as Complainant – contact the Chair. If the respondent is the Chair, then contact staff liaison on the Conflict Resolution Sub-committee. If the respondents involve multiple directors, the ED will contact the Internal Advisor.\n   - **Director** as Complainant – contact the ED. If the Respondent is the ED or Chair, then contact the Internal Advisor.\n   - **Member of the organization, or member of the public** as Complainant - contact the ED. If the Respondent is the ED, then the member contacts the Internal Advisor.\n4. The Responsible Contact Person will immediately acknowledge to the Complainant the receipt of the complaint.\n5. The Responsible Contact Person will forward the complaint to the Internal Advisor \\(if not self\\) within one \\(1\\) week of receipt. The Internal Advisor will then proceed as follows:\n\n   - The Internal Advisor will review the complaint to ensure all information is included as per 2.02 above, and that enough information is present to be able to assess the situation and respond. If not, the complainant will be advised.\n   - The review will include assessing and making note of organizational by-laws, policies and codes that might have been violated.\n   - If the issues raised by the complainant include matters that directly engage the Human Resources Policy, reports of harassment or discrimination based on protected grounds under the OHRC, or report incidents of Workplace Violence \\(as per the Occupational Health and Safety Act\\), the relevant policies and procedures will be followed. The Internal Advisor will immediately notify the designated contact people for those policies and procedures, and advise the Complainant of this. Immediate courses of action may include separation of parties and initiation of a third party investigation.\n\n     The review may also include seeking advice from the Advisory Group or other external source of expertise. If formal complaints involve multiple Complainants or Respondents that are staff and/or directors, or are non-HR contract disputes, the Internal Advisor shall seek Advisory Group or external legal advice. Such complaints may then be referred to some form of external adjudication process.\n\n6. Within one \\(1\\) week of complaint receipt, the Internal Advisor will: \\(i\\) inform the Complainant that they have carried out an initial review of their complaint; \\(ii\\) provide the Complainant with a copy of this Policy; \\(iii\\) review the informal dispute resolution process, and; \\(iv\\) communicate additional information required, including:\n   - Any referral of the complaint to a separate process, as per 2.05.1.\n   - Available informal or assisted resolution options as set out in this Policy, section 1.\n   - That processes in relation to this policy cannot result in an award of damages or compensation to the Complainant, Respondent, or anyone else;\n   - That processes in relation to this policy may or may not result in disciplinary measures against the Respondent.\n   - That the Respondent will receive a copy of the Complaint \\(with the Complainant’s name\\) if it is not resolved through informal resolution mechanisms.\n7. Notice to Respondent \\(Offer of Informal Dispute Resolution\\)\n   - Consistent with the timeline in 2.06, and when the appointed Internal Advisor is satisfied the requirements outlined above are met, and has determined that written complaint disclosure will not jeopardize the potential for an Informal Dispute Resolution process, the Internal Advisor will send the respondent:\n     - A copy of the complaint;\n     - Possibly supporting materials;\n     - An assessment of organizational policies and/or codes of practice that may be engaged;\n     - A copy of this policy;\n     - A request for a response within two \\(2\\) weeks;\n     - An offer to facilitate Informal Dispute Resolution.\n   - If the Respondent does not reply within one \\(1\\) week, the Internal Advisor will notify the ED \\(or alternate, as per 2.03 above\\), who will then decide a course of action with the information provided to date. They may consult with the Conflict Resolution Committee, as needed.\n8. Initial Response to the Complainant \\(Offer of Informal Dispute Resolution\\).\n\n   - Upon receipt of a timely response from the Respondent, the Internal Advisor will send to the complainant:\n     - A copy of the response;\n     - Possibly supporting materials;\n     - An assessment of organizational policies and/or codes of practice that may be engaged;\n     - An offer to facilitate Informal Dispute Resolution.\n   - If both parties accept the offer of Informal Dispute Resolution, the Internal Advisor will arrange within one \\(1\\) week to facilitate the Informal Dispute Resolution process. This may include such processes as informal meetings, negotiation, facilitated meetings or shuttle or in-person mediation. The Internal Advisor may engage a mediator external to the organization.\n   - Any agreed resolution of the complaint arrived at through Informal Dispute Resolution shall be documented in writing and signed by both Complainant and Respondent. These Minutes of Settlement shall be confidential, and items within strictly shared with the Internal Advisor, Staff, Board, legal counsel or other parties that need to know to carry out their organizational duties. Considerations when making an agreement should include:\n\n     - Is the agreement within the scope of the parties’ decision-making powers in relation to their organizational role?\n     - Is the agreement realistic and durable?\n     - Does the agreement in any way compromise DMG?\n     - Are there elements of the agreement that impact on the DMG’s operations, policies, reputation, external relationships or public perceptions?\n\n   - If both parties do not accept the offer of Informal Dispute Resolution, or if Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve the complaint, the Internal Advisor will immediately forward the Complainant’s and Respondent’s documentation and the Internal Advisor’s report on dispute resolution attempts to date, to the Conflict Resolution Committee. The Committee may then seek advice from the Advisory Group or other external source of expertise. The Conflict Resolution Committee will decide on a course of action with the information provided. Such action may include, but is not limited to:\n     - Separation of parties via work re-assignment or changing of scheduling;\n     - Having a meeting with each party to discuss best practices for dispute resolution;\n     - Directions on training;\n     - Implementation of organizational practice and policy changes;\n     - Referral to HR policies and procedures, Harassment and Discrimination policy and procedures, and/or OHSA-mandated policies and procedures for resolution.\n"},{"title":"Guide to Hosting and Attending Our Events on Zoom","path":"/manual/online-events-attendee-guide/","summary":"A guide to running and participating in online events using Zoom","content":"\n_For now, most of our online events will be held over Zoom, so this guide is written with that in mind. We've been using Zoom for the last couple of years for streaming workshops and classes. We're sensitive to privacy and security issues with this platform and are actively reviewing alternatives._\n\n## Safety\n\nAnything you say or do in a Zoom meeting – from video to audio to the chat – could be recorded without your consent by another attendee. Those recordings can then be shared with third parties who weren’t in the original meeting. This is a violation of our [code of conduct](/manual/code-of-conduct/) and we will remind all attendees to refrain from this behavior, which we consider harassing.\n\nWe record workshops and classes from time to time. You will be informed of this prior to the event start.\n\nTo prevent \"Zoom bombing\" we use waiting rooms and password protection on all event meetings hosted on Zoom. Should an event be targeted, our protocol is to end the meeting immediately, and start a new one. A link and password will be emailed to all attendees right away.\n\n## Event Team\n\nIn addition to the host/presenter, each event has a designated **captain**.\n\nThe captain's role is to start, configure, and monitor the entire event from start to finish – ensuring all protocols for safety and security are followed, and setting the stage for a smooth and disruption-free event for all participants.\n\nDepending on the number of attendees, events may also have an additional DMG volunteer to assist with responding to any issues such as disruptions and technical/logistical questions.\n\n## For Hosts\n\nBefore the event, establish:\n\n- Will attendees be participating or just observing/listening?\n- Can participants/attendees share their own screen and control their audio and video sharing?\n- How and when are questions asked and answered?\n\nThe captain should start the meeting 10-15 minutes before the scheduled start time to allow time for the volunteer, presenter and key participants to connect and ensure everything is configured correctly. Participants will be able to join as soon as the meeting has started; if the meeting isn't configured to use a Waiting Room, you can either put early participants On Hold or simply accept their presence and let them know that you'll be starting soon.\n\nThe captain or volunteer (co-host), should review the following settings before the event starts:\n\n- _Mute attendees_. Click \"Manage Participants\" at the bottom of the Zoom window, and click \"Mute All\" near the bottom of the Participants window. You can uncheck \"Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves\" if you do not want participants to be able to interject – this should be determined in advance of the meeting and is dependent on the format.\n- _Review screen-sharing options_. Click the arrow next to the \"Share\" button at the bottom of the main Zoom window to open the \"Advanced Sharing Options...\" pop-up and review the settings for \"Who can share?\" and \"Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing?\" Most of the time, this should be set to \"Only Host\" – exceptions are multi-presenter panels and socials.\n- _Review chat settings_. Depending on the event, you may want to restrict the chat window to \"Host Only\" and ask that attendees chat in Slack instead.\n\nOnce the event begins, the captain should set the expectations for the group, including:\n\n- Community guidelines – post a link to our [code of conduct](https://manual.dmg.to/manual/code-of-conduct/) in the Chat window\n- Describe the format of the event and what features are enabled/disabled and why\n- Set out any ground rules and expectations for participation particular to the format of the event\n\nThe captain should remain in the meeting for the entirety of the event and should not be performing other roles, including facilitation, presentation or active participation. This allows them to focus on watching for and addressing safety, security and technical issues that may disrupt the event.\n\nThe captain should keep their main Zoom window as large as possible, set to Gallery view. The current speaker's thumbnail image is outlined in a yellow border.\n\nKeep the Participants window open to ensure you can see who has joined the meeting. Microphone and video icons show who is muted and unmuted.\n\nAdditionally, if Chat is enabled, keep the Zoom Group Chat window open and visible throughout the event and monitor for any inappropriate content or respond to questions or requests from participants, presenters and other safety team members.\n\nFinally, if using the Waiting Room feautre, keep an eye on participants waiting to join, and approve them individually or en masse.\n\n## For Attendees\n\n## Logistics\n\nPlease arrive a few minutes in advance of the start time so that we can start on time. Some sessions have a waiting room – you'll be granted access momentarily.\n\n### Audio\n\nAll events will start with all attendees set to mute to keep ambient sound down as the host begins the event. Depending on the format of the event, you may be able to unmute yourself to speak or ask a question at any time.\n\n### Video\n\nYou can join any event with your video turned off, or turn it off at any time during the event.\n\n### Name\n\nWe encourage attendees to set their display name to the name you'd ask someone to call you at an in-person event, and to add your pronouns if you wish. Our policy is to default to gender neutral pronouns in case we don't know yours.\n\n### Chat\n\nPlease join the Slack channel for the event for ongoing conversation, and feel free to use the built-in chat in the meeting tool for questions and introductions during the event.\n\n### Breakout Rooms\n\nSome events will split up large groups for smaller conversations. The host will assign you to a room automatically and bring everyone back together once the breakout portion is done. The host will let everyone know the format of the breakout, but generally, do not feel obligated to chat with others in your group. Take it as a moment for a bio break if you need to!\n\n### Accessibility needs\n\nWe want to create a fully accessible space online for all of our community members. If you require captioning, sign-language interpretation, or another accommodation, please [contact us](mailto:events@dmg.to) a week before your class or event. We hope to eventually be able to offer captioning by default at all of our online workshops.\n"},{"title":"New Members","path":"/manual/index/","summary":"All about DMG!","content":"\n> “But we are a play community, and playing the way we do, for fun, for everyone’s fun, in public – our fun little community becomes something else.

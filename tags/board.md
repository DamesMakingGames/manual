The Dames Making Games \(“DMG”\) Board Manual defines the role of the Board and how it will carry out its responsibilities. This and the [By-Laws](/by-laws.md) are DMG’s primary governing documents.

First drafted in 2012, the purpose of this document is to clarify the organization’s principles and goals, and define the roles and responsibilities of Board members as we aspire to fulfill our mission and vision.

## Revisions

Changes will be adopted through a majority vote of the Board at Board meetings. Proposed policy changes will be provided to Board members in advance of the meeting at which the vote is to be taken. Board-approved revisions will be tracked through a digital version control system.

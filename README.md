# DMG Manual

The DMG Manual documents our mission, values, structures, policies, tools, and guides that help our members understand and shape how we work and play together.

This document is reviewed and updated regularly by our board of directors, volunteers, organizers and committee members. It is a living document, and we invite pull requests, [issues](/manual/issues), questions and feedback. Read more about the process of suggesting changes or adding new content [here](https://manual.dmg.to/manual/how-to-edit-this-manual/).

## Contributing

To add new content in the manual, first create a file in the `manual` directory. Frontmatter should look like:

```
---
title: "Code of Conduct"
date: 2020-04-15
summary: DMG's Code of Conduct.
path: /code-of-conduct
tags: ["code-of-conduct", "community-manual"]
---
```

The body of the file must be written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Tags

Tags are used to structure the manual. If youâ€™d like to use a new tag, create a file in the `tag` directory. Only frontmatter is required. For example:

```
---
id: organizers-manual
title: "Organizers Manual"

```
